    <p>the reason i think u are super strong is that you really did went through a ton without asking anyone for help. i am really sorry for being the way i was in the past. i would make u tell me ur problem and instead of really solving it just made u more sad. but thanks to that i am able to understand people better look from a different view and finally know whatever was  happening in ur life. but idc about that anymore because the main goal was to make u happy which i hope u are right now. but i still feel guilty about so just know that from now on if u have have burden on ur head or any problem big or small i swear i will never force u to tell me against your will but i still wanna request one thing that whenever u are down call me i will cheer u  up even if u are sad or happy alr i will make u happier and that is a promise i can make. pinky promise:)</p>
