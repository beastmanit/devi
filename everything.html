    <div><p>the real reason i wanted to make this website is not because of your birthday. ofcourse it is a part of it but the main reason i wanted to make this website is so that you will always remember a very important thing.that is to take care of yourself.  i am not going to be around always cuz ill most prolly be in abroad after 12th. so i am making this website so that whenever you are sad,feeling insecure or anything else just come to this website cuz it only contains the things i truly think about you and nothing in it is a total lie. ofcourse even if all you need is a small laugh come to this website  imma put some funny stuff further inside the website.yea so this is just for me to remind  you that whenever something happens just come to this website cuz im going to be making sure of it that it will sort everything out. </p></div>
