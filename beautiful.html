        dude like its literally a flex that someone like you is my bestfriend. you are really pretty but ig that is for sure already ig since you are my bestfriend. ok ok ik that i always make fun of ur looks and all but never believe any of it that is just a way of me showing that i care about u and yes that is by making fun of u. but if that ever makes u insecure pls just tell me when im going overboard just tell me i cuz ofc none of it is true. bro u are really beautiful but still not my fault  ur destiny filled with guys like jai, lassi, kai etc. but there is one thing you are not only beautiful from the face u  are the one of the most prettiest person i have ever met. yk how?  bcuz of ur soul which is alot more pure that most of the ppl ik.
